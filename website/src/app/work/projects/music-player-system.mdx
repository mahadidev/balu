The `--related` feature uses intelligent keyword matching to automatically find and queue songs similar to what you're playing:

### How It Works
- **Language Detection**: Automatically recognizes Bangla, Hindi, English, and other languages
- **Genre Recognition**: Identifies rock, pop, rap, romantic, and other music styles
- **Era Matching**: Detects years in song titles for time-period specific recommendations
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Uses current popular hits when no specific genre is detected

### Usage Examples
```
!play "Shape of You" --related      → Adds popular pop hits
!play_related "Bohemian Rhapsody"   → Adds classic rock songs (no flag needed)
/play_related Tum Hi Ho             → Adds Bollywood favorites (slash command)
!play "Lose Yourself" --related     → Adds hip-hop classics
```

### Categories Supported
